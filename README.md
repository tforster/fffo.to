# fffo.to v0.1.0

_A distributed mobile bullet-time proof of concept_

A group of people holding their mobile phones form a rough circle around the subject. All users have loaded the fffo.to web application
in their favourite browser and are connected to a designated "control" user via web sockets. When the "control" user taps her shutter 
button each of the other users shutters fire sequentially after a few milliseconds delay. The resulting images are sent to the controler
device where they are assembled into an animated-bullet-time-effect gif.
